# FakeGUISystem-Console

Hello everyone. 

This is basically a simulated system with graphic user interface in console. 

Until present, due to various reasons, I still haven't finished even the most fundamental modules of this application. The only integrated program within it is a notepad. In other words, it is a fairly well plain text editor: as long as your input text is not incredibly long. Seriously. 

I will update it **SLOWLY** in the foreseeable future. 

See you and have fun. 

// After finished (I sincerely hope so), you can use the `AddProgram()` method in `ExteriorSealedCode` namespace to add more personalized programs.
